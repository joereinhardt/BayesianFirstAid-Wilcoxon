Title: A Bayesian Alternative to the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test 
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Joachim Reinhardt

Description: A Bayesian alternative for the Wilcoxon signed rank test - 
    from Rasmus Bååth's to-do list for his Bayesian First Aid package 
    (https://github.com/rasmusab/bayesian_first_aid/tree/master/R). 
    The Bayesian alternative for the Wilcoxon is set up as suggested by 
    Andrew Gelman (http://andrewgelman.com/2015/07/13/dont-do-the-wilcoxon/) via
    1) replacement of the data by their ranks,
    2) translation of ranks into z-scores, and 
    3) modeling the difference between the two groups as a normal 
    distribution with uninformative priors.
