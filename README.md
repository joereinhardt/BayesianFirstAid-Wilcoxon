# BayesianFirstAid-Wilcoxon
A Bayesian alternative for the Wilcoxon signed rank test - from Rasmus Bååth's to-do list for his Bayesian First Aid package (https://github.com/rasmusab/bayesian_first_aid/tree/master/R).
The Bayesian alternative for the Wilcoxon is set up as suggested by Andrew Gelman (http://andrewgelman.com/2015/07/13/dont-do-the-wilcoxon/) via 1) replacement of the data by their ranks, 2) translation of ranks into z-scores, and 3) modeling the difference between the two groups as a normal distribution with uninformative priors.
